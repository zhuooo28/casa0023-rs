This weekâ€™s practical involves digital image processing, remote sensing information extraction technologies and methods, such as pattern recognition, supervised classification, unsupervised classification, information extraction using artificial intelligence, etc. It discusses techniques such as support vector machines, random forest classifiers, and remote sensing thematic map accuracy assessment in detail. In addition, the method of using Google Earth Engine for cloud-based remote sensing data processing is also introduced, including the process of data acquisition, vector data processing, and the use of different algorithms for image classification and accuracy evaluation. Through practical cases, I learned how to process remote sensing data, perform land cover classification, and evaluate the accuracy of classification results. Random forest is an ensemble learning method that improves the accuracy and robustness of classification by building multiple decision trees. In remote sensing image processing, random forests can effectively process large amounts of data and provide accurate classification results. I am mainly interested in how to train a random forest classifier on the GEE platform, including selecting training and validation samples, training the classifier using the random forest algorithm, and evaluating the accuracy of the classification results. This process involves segmenting the data set, selecting an appropriate feature set, and using tools such as confusion matrices to verify the classification effect. In addition, the practical also emphasizes how to avoid overfitting (shown in the figure below) when processing remote sensing images and ensure the generalization ability of the model by correctly segmenting the data set.

### Applications:

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is widely used in many fields because of its powerful data analysis capabilities and large geographical information data sets. Some major applications include: environmental monitoring, agriculture, climate change research, land cover mapping, disaster management, etc.

Among them, in agriculture, GEE can be used to monitor crops, predict yields, and manage agricultural resources more effectively. It helps assess crop health, soil moisture, and predict pest infestations. Mutanga and Kumar (2019) studied several key applications of GEE in agriculture, including crop yield estimation, crop area mapping, pest and disease vulnerability and suitability assessment. Among them, using Terra MODIS data and Landsat data, GEE was able to estimate the total primary productivity of seven crops in Montana, USA, from 2008 to 2015 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. High spatial resolution Worldview 2 data were used to map smallholder heterogeneous farmland areas in the African context of Mali. This mapping utilizes set rules to optimize classification accuracy, demonstrating the high processing power of GEE. Moreover, using a combination of 10-day period Sentinel data and 16-day period Landsat TM data, a map of farmland and non-farmland area across the African continent was drawn. And classify the above data using random forest algorithm and recursive hierarchical partitioning to further analyze and understand the data.

There is also a study on Canadian cropping intensity (ACI) mapping using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Amani et al. (2020) proposed a cloud computing method using a combination of multi-date Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2018, implemented on the GEE platform, to generate object-based ACI maps. By applying artificial neural networks (ANN), 17 farmland categories in 10 Canadian provinces were delineated. The research results show that the overall classification accuracy is 77%, and the average producer accuracy (PA) and user accuracy (UA) of the cultivated land category are 79% and 77% respectively. It also proves that using the GEE cloud platform and open-access Sentinel-1/-2 satellite images greatly reduces time and economic costs compared to using local computing resources and expensive RADARSAT-2 images, helping to automate future ACI maps. Production.

These two studies demonstrate the application of Google Earth Engine (GEE) in the agricultural field, especially the potential in crop monitoring, yield prediction, and resource management. Although their geographical areas of focus and specific applications are different, they collectively reflect GEE's ability to process large amounts of geospatial data and perform efficient classification and analysis. Both studies used satellite data, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat data, for map production and analysis. And both aim to improve agricultural management and monitoring through more precise geospatial data analysis, such as crop yield estimation, farmland classification, etc. However, the first study focused more on the estimation of total primary productivity of crops, mapping of farmland area and classification of small-scale farmland using high-resolution data using methods such as ensemble rules and random forest algorithms. The second study focuses on using artificial neural network (ANN) technology to generate object-based crop intensity (ACI) maps on the GEE platform. Through these studies, we can see the broad applicability and benefits of GEE in agricultural research in different regions around the world.

### Reflection:

The Google Earth Engine (GEE) we learned this week is inspiring, and it vividly demonstrates the combination of programming and geospatial analysis. When I first tried programming in GEE using JavaScript, I found it difficult but took it as a challenge. Through these, I realized the importance of independent learning and problem solving. When encountering programming difficulties, although the code in the tutorial is very detailed, when trying to fully understand it, I learned how to search for relevant information, read documents, and ask peers for help. These abilities will be extremely valuable for my future study and work. of.
