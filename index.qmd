# About me {.unnumbered}

Hello, I am Yizhuo Shi, you can call me Zoe, I am from China. Currently, I am an MSc student in Urban Spatial Science at University College London. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Liverpool, majoring in Computer Science.

I am passionate about how technology can be used to improve and understand our urban environments. From a young age, I have been deeply interested in technology and the natural world, and this interest has led me to my current academic path. My studies in computer science have given me a deep understanding of the power of technology, and my current major has opened my eyes to the possibilities of applying this power to urban and environmental issues.

In my remote sensing studies, I am particularly looking forward to learning how remote sensing data and technology can be effectively used to solve real-world problems, such as urban planning, disaster management, and environmental protection. I am also looking forward to interacting and collaborating with students from different backgrounds, as I believe that diverse perspectives can inspire more innovative ideas.

I am glad that you can read my diary, please advise me more!
