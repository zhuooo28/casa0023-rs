## Week 1: Introduction to Remote Sensing and Practical Application

### Summary:

This week's session offered a comprehensive introduction to remote sensing, emphasizing its pivotal role in urban and environmental studies. The lecture detailed various technologies, particularly the distinction between passive and active sensors, and their interaction with electromagnetic waves. In the practical session, we applied these concepts using Sentinel and Landsat data, focusing on York' s urban landscape. It was a blend of theoretical understanding and practical data analysis. This is a mind map.

### Applications:

I was intrigued by how remote sensing is applied in real-world scenarios, particularly in urban planning and environmental monitoring. The practical session's data analysis of York highlighted this application vividly. It allowed me to see firsthand how remote sensing data could be used to observe and assess urban expansion and land use changes.

### Reflection:

The transition from theoretical concepts to practical application was particularly enlightening. The hands-on analysis of satellite data made the abstract concepts more tangible and relevant. It underscored the significance of remote sensing in contemporary urban and environmental challenges, especially in the context of rapid urbanization and climate change.

### Practical Insights:

Engaging directly with tools and data, such as SNAP and R, for processing satellite imagery was a highlight. The experience of analyzing data from different satellites underscored the complexity and precision involved in remote sensing. This practical insight not only enhanced my understanding of the theoretical aspects but also sparked a deeper interest in the potential applications of this technology in various fields.

This week has been an enriching start to the course, laying a solid foundation in both the theory and practice of remote sensing. The combination of lecture and practical application has been instrumental in deepening my understanding and appreciation of this field.
