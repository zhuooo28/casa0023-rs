# Week4

## Week 4: Policy

### Summary:

The city I chose is the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta. Jakarta is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. The city is facing many challenges, including rapid urbanization, traffic congestion, air pollution, land subsidence due to falling water tables (25cm per year), and severe flood risk. These The problem not only threatens the sustainable development of cities, but also affects the quality of life of residents.

Among them, the most serious problem is subsidence caused by rising sea levels, Jakarta is located on the northwest coast of Java, Indonesia. Parts of the city are built on swampland. This geological structure itself is relatively prone to subsidence. In addition, rising sea levels caused by global warming have exacerbated Jakarta's subsidence problem, especially in coastal areas, which face greater risks of flooding. Some human factors also lead to ground subsidence. First, huge amounts of underground water pumping, primarily for residential, commercial and industrial water use, became an uncontrolled activity (Colven, 2020). Second, rapid urban expansion and large-scale construction projects have increased ground pressure, especially in swamps and soft soil. Third, the system has insufficient drainage, such as frequent rainfall that prevents ground moisture from draining away.

More details are in the video below.

In order to solve the subsidence problem in Jakarta, the Indonesian government and local agencies are taking a series of measures: Restrict groundwater extraction: Adopt laws and policies to limit illegal groundwater extraction and promote the use of alternative water sources, such as surface water and recycled water. Build seawalls and locks: Build large-scale seawall and lock projects to control seawater intrusion and mitigate the effects of flooding. Improve urban drainage systems: Improve and expand urban drainage systems to increase their ability to handle rainfall and flooding. Sustainable urban planning: Promote green building and sustainable urban planning concepts to reduce negative impacts on the environment and address the challenges posed by land subsidence.

Some predictions indicate that Jakarta will completely sink by 2050. Therefore, the government and relevant departments should continue to speed up the pace and actively respond. The next section: "Application" will talk about the specific application of remote sensing technology in sea level rise and ground subsidence.

### Applications:

Remote sensing technology plays an important role in helping to deal with land subsidence. It can provide effective detection and analysis of all aspects. First, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology can provide high-resolution surface deformation images to help identify and monitor ground subsidence areas. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technology used to monitor surface deformation. It can accurately detect small changes in the surface such as land subsidence, landslides and post-earthquake deformation. InSAR technology analyzes micro-deformations on the ground through images acquired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR).

Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technology used to monitor surface deformation. It can accurately detect small changes in the surface such as land subsidence, landslides and post-earthquake deformation. InSAR technology analyzes tiny deformations on the ground through images acquired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR). InSAR data allows for time series analysis, which has become an important tool for detecting, measuring, and analyzing displacements on the Earth's surface (Osmanoğlu et al., 2016). In addition, SAR measurements include both amplitude and phase observations. Amplitude refers to the intensity of backscattered electromagnetic waves, which is related to the shape, direction and electrical characteristics of the target. The phase reflects the change of the wave, but it is difficult to accurately obtain the total number of distance or wavelength. By comparing the phase changes in the two SAR measurements, we can detect the small changes that occurred between the two imaging times. This method is called InSAR (Osmanoğlu et al., 2016). The following figure illustrates the basic observable phase of a typical InSAR measurement.

In this study, Osmanoğlu et al. (2016) used InSAR data time series analysis to compare the performance of four different algorithms (PSI, SBAS, SqueeSAR, StaMPS) in dealing with land subsidence monitoring in Mexico City. The study found that despite the high ground subsidence rate in Mexico City, the four algorithms all obtained similar settlement rates and deformation patterns, but the StaMPS method gave a lower settlement rate. Studies have also shown that deformation rates in the northeastern farmland area are difficult to obtain due to the lack of persistent scatterers and interference from agricultural activities. In addition, the theory of combining time series analysis with phase unwrapping can provide potential technical and computational advantages for analyzing InSAR observations in three dimensions (two space and one time).

#### Reflection:

After delving deeply into this week's course content on remote sensing data processing and applications, I found that I have a strong interest and curiosity in how to apply this knowledge to a wider field. But again, this is a bit difficult for me. After learning about data correction techniques, I started thinking about how these techniques could be used in current and future research, and how they might open up new avenues of analysis or work. For example, atmospheric correction, terrain correction, and radiometric correction are not only critical for improving the quality of remote sensing images, but also provide us with a means to better understand the Earth system through more accurate data. Mastery of these correction techniques allows me to think about how they can be applied to solve practical problems in areas such as environmental monitoring, agricultural development, and urban planning. In addition, the learning and application of these remote sensing data processing techniques prompted me to think about other potential research areas, such as using remote sensing techniques for climate change research or disaster response. As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, the effective use of remote sensing data to monitor glacier retreat, sea level rise, and extreme climate events has become an important task. This requires not only precise data correction techniques, but also interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative approaches to parse large amounts of data. In the end, I realized that while this week's course content provided me with valuable knowledge and skills, it was just the beginning. Learning remote sensing techniques and data processing methods opens a way to explore the Earth and our role in it. As technology continues to advance and data sets expand, there will be greater opportunities to explore new questions, discover new insights, and have a profound impact on our world. I look forward to applying this knowledge to my future studies and research, not only to solve existing problems but also to open up new avenues of analysis and work. This week’s learning experience not only strengthened my technical skills, but more importantly, it sparked my interest and curiosity in applying these tools and data to a wider range of disciplines and challenges.
