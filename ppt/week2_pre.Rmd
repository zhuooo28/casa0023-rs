## Part 2: Spatial data {.center}

## What is spatial data?

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
-   The earth is a 3D sphere (well, almost). It's wider than it is tall
-   In order to locate a point on the surface of a sphere, we need a set of coordinates
-   Coordinates will tell us how near to the top or bottom of the sphere we are, or how far around
-   But where do we start?
:::

![](img/3d_globe.jpg){fig-align="center" width="548"}

## What is spatial data 2?

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
**Geographic Coordinate Reference System**

-   treats the globe as if it was a sphere divided into 360 equal parts called degrees

<br/>

**Projected Coordinate Reference System**

-   flat, two-dimensional plane (through projecting a spheroid onto a 2D surface) giving it constant lengths, angles and areas

## Big data {.center}

> Big geospatial data include datasets that are too large to be processed using **traditional GIS tools**

## Why are they large?

**Raster**

-   Landsat satellite data: 400 scenes of Earth a day, revising each location every 16 days

    -   Each scene is about 1GB
    -   We'd used Google Earth Engine - not considered here

**Vector**

-   New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) all records from Yellow and Green Cabs

    -   150GB, 1.2 billion records

-   Open Street Map

    -   1764.5GB when uncompressed

## What can we do about it?

#### Parquet files

-   We are moving from row based storage **to column based**

-   About 50x faster than a .csv

-   It groups our data.

    -   For example a row group size of 2, puts rows all the data from 1 and 2 next to each other **then** we have 3! = GROUPS or PARTITION

    -   If we have large data this means we can skip groups we don't need

## Concepts

-   You may come across **Arrow** - this is an in-memory format, **Parquet** is a storage format

Â 

-   In the R for Data Science book a 9BG `.csv` is queried in

    -   11 seconds for standard code
    -   0.063 seconds using a parquet file! 100x faster

## We can go faster!

<br/>

![](img/duck.jpg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## DuckDB

-   Database management system

-   Columnar data

-   No installation

-   Convert our Parquet file to DuckDB and back again!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
to_duckdb() 
to_arrow()
```

> Regarding performance, parquet is 717 times faster than the same query on a csv file, and duckdb is 2808 times faster.

## Notes

-   All (parquet and DuckDB) make sure of `dplyr` ! `select()`, `filter()`, `groupby()` = direct integration with R

-   Currently the **support for spatial data** is very limited

-   [sfarrow](https://wcjochem.github.io/sfarrow/articles/example_sfarrow.html) - can load and query the data but can't do any analysis!

## Postgres

![](img/Postgresql_elephant.svg.png){height="300px" fig-align="center"}

## Postgres = object-relational database

[![DVD Rental Model](img/dvd-rental-sample-database-diagram.png){fig-align="center" width="38%"}](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/)

## PostgreSQL has a PostGIS extention {.center}

## This allows the "geometry" column and spatial quieres {auto-animate="true"}

#### Making random points in polygons

5 million random points

-   QGIS = 226 seconds
-   PostGIS = 18 seconds

## PostGIS

<br/>

![](img/PostGIS_logo.png){height="300px" fig-align="center"}

## Starting

-   Despite all these tools we must start with the basics.

-   Often this is in Quantum GIS (free) or ArcMap(\$)

-   We will be exploring QGIS in the workshop later

All of the implementations were tested with the same input data.

**They all gave the same results except the ESRI/ArcGIS** implementation (LiÂ 2018)

and although ESRI provide help for the GWR tools, the actual coding is closed---the underlying code is not revealed

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

##### Part 2: GIS analysis, example practice question

> New York City wish to conduct a study that aims to prevent people being evicted through understand possible related factors.You have been enlisted as a consultant and tasked to conduct an analysis of their data from 2020.

Data:

-   [List of evictions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4)
-   [New York City community districts](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Community-Districts/yfnk-k7r4)

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

#### DISCUSS

-   How were the evictions recorded

-   Why were there limited evictions during 2020/ then a sudden peak? - COVID ban on evictions

-   How can identifying spatially related factors to evictions be useful

-   Are there certain areas that have higher evictions than others - why might this be?

-   What assumption does the data make

-   What assumptions does the model make

## 2. Make it mandatory for the assessment

Students

-   Click the URL and generates a new repository

-   Staff can see their work and when they make edits (commit / push)

![](img/student_repo.png){fig-align="center" width="593"}

## Conclusion

-   It is essential to use data to inform decisions...BUT we must develop a **critical awareness** of:

    -   How the data has been created
    -   How the boundary data has been created
    -   What **the agenda** was for collecting the data

-   In addition we must recognize that:

    -   Data is a **snapshot / sample** of the population
    -   Analysis attempts to **model the world** - it is *never* perfect.
